# Stripe Connect for Dashboard

The Stripe Connect module allows users to complete additional registration information and receive payouts through some action on your platform.

## Import this module

Install the module with NPM:

    $ npm install @userdashboard/stripe-connect

Edit your `package.json` to activate the module:

    "dashboard": {
      "modules": [
        "@userdashboard/stripe-connect"
      ]
    }
    
## Setting up your Stripe credentials

You will need to retrieve various keys from [Stripe](https://stripe.com).  During development your webhook will be created automatically, but in production with multiple dashboard server instances they share a configured webhook:

- create your Stripe account and find your API keys
- create a webhook for https://your_domain/webhooks/connect/index-connect-data 
- environment STRIPE_KEY=sk_test_xxxxxxx
- environment STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_xxxxxxx
- environment CONNECT_WEBHOOK_ENDPOINT_SECRET=whsec_xxxxxxxx
