# Dashboard translations

This is a WIP endeavor to translate all Dashboard content so it can be useful in any country.  The translations must be performed by volunteers.  

## Contributions welcome and necesary

To assist in translating browse the project on Github and click the pencil to edit any pages you want to help translate.

If you would like to add a language variation create a copy in a new folder, `language-country-code`.

Translations of content for organizations, Stripe Subscriptions and Stripe Connect can be found in their project repositories on Github.
