# Stripe Connect module for Dashboard

![Guest landing page](https://userdashboard.github.io/outline.png?raw=true) 

Dashboard is a parallel web application that accompanies your web app, subscription service, or Stripe Connect platform to provide all the "boilerplate" a modern web app requires to serve its users.  Use Dashboard instead of rewriting user account and login systems.  This module adds UI and APIs for a complete [Stripe Connect](https://stripe.com/connect) custom integration.

## Import this module

Edit your `package.json` to activate the module:

    "dashboard": {
      "modules": [
        "@userdashboard/stripe-connect"
      ]
    }

Install the module with NPM:

    $ npm install @userdashboard/stripe-connect

## Setting up your Stripe credentials

In development your webhook can be created automatically, but in production since you might have multiple Dashboard server instances you must set it up manually.

- create your Stripe account and find your API keys
- create a webhook for https://your_domain/webhooks/connect/index-connect-data 
- environment STRIPE_KEY=sk_test_xxxxxxx
- environment STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_xxxxxxx
- environment CONNECT_WEBHOOK_ENDPOINT_SECRET=whsec_xxxxxxxx

### Case studies 

`Hastebin` is an open source pastebin web application.  It started as a service for anonymous guests only, and was transformed with Dashboard and modules into a web application for registered users with support for sharing posts with organizations and paid subscriptions.
